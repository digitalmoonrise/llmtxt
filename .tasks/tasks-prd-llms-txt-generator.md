# Technical Task Breakdown: LLMs.txt Generator for Shopify

Based on PRD: `prd-llms-txt-generator.md`

## Important Technical Limitation

**Shopify theme extensions CANNOT create files at the root domain** (e.g., `yourstore.com/llms.txt`). However, **since `/llms.txt` will return a 404, we can automatically create a redirect** to our page template.

## Revised Approach

Our app automatically handles everything so users get `/llms.txt` functionality via redirect without any manual work:

1. **Automatic Page Creation**: App creates page template at `/pages/llms-txt` serving plain text content
2. **Automatic Redirect Setup**: App programmatically creates 301 redirect from `/llms.txt` â†’ `/pages/llms-txt`
3. **Zero User Intervention**: Users get working `yourstore.com/llms.txt` redirect without installing anything manually
4. **Seamless Experience**: From user perspective, `/llms.txt` redirects to the content (not true root domain serving)

## URL Structure

- **Root Domain**: `yourstore.com/llms.txt` (301 redirect to `/pages/llms-txt`)
- **Page Template**: `yourstore.com/pages/llms-txt` (automatically created, serves content)
- **User Experience**: Users access `yourstore.com/llms.txt` which redirects to the content

## Implementation Strategy

1. **App automatically creates** page template that outputs llms.txt content as `text/plain`
2. **App automatically creates** 301 redirect from `/llms.txt` to `/pages/llms-txt` via Admin API
3. **App verifies** redirect works and returns proper 301 status
4. **App manages** updates and maintenance automatically
5. **Users experience** `/llms.txt` redirect functionality without any manual steps
